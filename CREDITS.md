I must thank the following people for the knowledge and help they've given me when making all of these scripts. Credits are organized by programming language. If there's someone I missed, please, let me know.

Also, please note that some individual credits aren't included here, such as those that may be very specific to a script, so they are included in their respective pieces of code.
