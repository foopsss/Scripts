# Scripts
Here I store some scripts made with the help of the Internet community that I'd like to share.

* **ADB/Fastboot Tool**: command-line appliance that aims to provide an easier way of using ADB and Fastboot. It's only available in spanish and requires [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), whether they are installed system-wide or run from the platform-tools folder.
  * The Windows version is made with Batch and the Linux one (W.I.P.) with Bash.
* **Backup Tool**: Powershell script that makes backups of different stuff. It has hardcoded paths as it',s specific to my computer. Only available in spanish.
* **Hosts Downloader**: little mix of Batch and Powershell that modifies the hosts file and overwrites it with the latest version of my [hosts-porn](https://github.com/foopsss/hosts/blob/master/hosts-porn) file. It sets the file as read-only at the end, to make modifications to it a bit harder, and read-write at the start of the process.
* **Calibri Installer**: Bash script that installs the calibri fonts for the local user. Font files not bundled with it.
