# Scripts
Some scripts made by me (**that wouldn't be a thing without the Internet community!**), that I'd like to share.

* **ADB/Fastboot Tool**: Batch command-line appliance that aims to provide an easier way of using ADB and Fastboot. It's only available in spanish.
  * It requires [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), whether they are installed system-wide or run from the platform-tools folder.
* **Backup Tool**: Powershell script that makes backups of different stuff. Has hardcoded paths, as it's specific to my computer. It's only available in spanish.
* **Hosts Downloader**: little mix of Batch and Powershell that modifies the hosts file and overwrites it with the latest version of my [hosts-porn](https://github.com/foopsss/hosts/blob/master/hosts-porn) file. It sets the file as read-only, to make modifications to it a bit harder.
* **Calibri Installer**: Bash script that installs the calibri fonts for the local user. Font files not bundled with it.
